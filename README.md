# Website-Sequence

A Chrome extension that allows a user to go through a sequence of websites they set up at the click of a button

To install, go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/websitesequence/hconcjobllldfkgdheebnipjgioadkao or search in the Chrome Web Store for "WebsiteSequence".  Once there, click the "Add to Chrome" button in the upper right corner.

To add new sequences and websites, go to the options page for this extension, available either through the settings page for extensions or by clicking the browser action button (next to the address bar on the right; orange arrow) and clicking the "Options" button.  

Once a sequence has been created, click the browser action, then click the button with the name of the sequence.  This will take you to the first page in the sequence to be visited on the current day of the week.  Subsequent clicks on the browser action will take you through the rest of the sequence.  Once all the websites have been visited, clicking the browser action will return you to the page for choosing a sequence.
